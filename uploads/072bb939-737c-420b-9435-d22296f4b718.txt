This is a test document for the FastAPI QA application. It contains multiple sentences to test the chunking functionality. The document processor should be able to extract text and create appropriate chunks for vector processing. This is another sentence to ensure we have enough content for proper chunking. The system should handle various document types including PDF, Word documents, and plain text files. Each chunk should maintain proper context and overlap for better search results.
